## Code

**HopBrod.py**

```
presented on Day2 -- Hopfield-Brody network using INVL ArtificialCell or HH cell

uses IClamp for HH cell rate randomization

```

**invlfire.mod**

`NMODL source file for INVL ArtificialCell used by HopBrod.py`

**HopBrodNetPyNE.py**

```
shortened and simplified version of netpyne/doc/source/code/tut7.py
uses HH with NetStims for HH cell rate randomization
```

## Additional Exercises

- `Accessing and making github repos`

    get a github account from http://github.com

    set up a repo for your LASCON project

    access github repos for [NetPyNE](https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne) and [NEURON](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn)
